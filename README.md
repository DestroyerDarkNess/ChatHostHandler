# ChatHostHandler
Adds the function to detect entered commands to the chat in SAMP.  This Plugin is Indispensable for Developing .ASI in C# / VB

Note:

I found the code a long time ago at https://www.blast.hk/ , and saved it. Credits to the Creator...

For my part, I added the Callback function, to be able to use it in .NET.

When I find the original author, I will put his name.
